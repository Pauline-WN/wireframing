# Figmify: From Wireframe to Prototype

## Introduction to Wireframing
Wireframing is a foundational step in the UI/UX design process. It involves creating a skeletal layout of a digital product's interface to plan the structure and functionality before full visual design and development begin.

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize and align on layout, user flows, and key features, reducing miscommunication and development risks.
