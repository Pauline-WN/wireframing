# Figmify: From Wireframe to Prototype

## Introduction to Wireframing
Wireframing is a foundational step in the UI/UX design process. It involves creating a skeletal layout of a digital product's interface to plan the structure and functionality before full visual design and development begin.

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize and align on layout, user flows, and key features, reducing miscommunication and development risks.

## Key Elements of Wireframing

Here are the core elements of an effective wireframe:

- **Layout Structure**: Defines how content is arranged on a screen. Example: grid-based layout for responsive design.
- **Navigation**: Guides users through the interface. Example: top nav bars, side menus, breadcrumb trails.
- **Content Placement**: Indicates where text, images, and media will appear. Example: placing a hero image at the top for visual engagement.
- **Functionality**: Represents interactive components. Example: buttons, forms, and modals to simulate user interaction.
